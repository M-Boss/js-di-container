# js-di-container
A simple yet adequately powerful dependency injection container to help implement IoC in Javascript
It supports registering/binding:
- classes
- function constructors
- factory function

Auto sub-dependency resolution is supported.
Services can be resolved as singletons or new instances each time they are requested.
